.Sh NAME
.Nm xinstall
.Nd install binaries
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm xinstall
.Op Fl bCcDdFpSsUv
.Op Fl B Ar suffix
.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Op Fl o Ar owner
.Ar source ... target ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Ar source
file(s) are copied to the
.Ar target
file or directory.
If the
.Ar target
file already exists, it is either renamed to
.Ar file.bak
if the
.Fl b
option is given
or overwritten
if permissions allow.
An alternate backup suffix may be specified via the
.Fl B
option's argument.
If the
.Fl d
option is given,
.Ar target
directories are created, and no files are copied.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-B suffix"
.It Fl B Ar suffix
Use
.Ar suffix
as the backup suffix if
.Fl b
is given.
.It Fl b
Backup any existing files before overwriting them by renaming
them to
.Ar file.bak .
See
.Fl B
for specifying a different backup suffix.
.It Fl C
Compare and copy the file.
If the target file already exists and the files are the same,
then installation does not change the modification time of the
target.
.It Fl c
Copy the file.
This is the default.
The
.Fl c
option is only included for backwards compatibility.
.It Fl D
Create all leading components of the target before installing into it.
When the
.Fl D
option is specified, any new or existing directory components will have
the default (0755) permissions applied.  If the
.Fl D
option is specified in conjunction with
.Fl m ,
the requested mode will be set for the target file.
If more restrictive directory permissions are required,
.Nm
.Fl d
.Fl m
should be used first to create the directories, followed by
.Nm
.Fl c
to install the files.
.It Fl d
Create directories, without installing files.
Missing parent directories are created as required. If a directory
already exists, the owner, group, and mode is set according to the
values specified on the command line. This option cannot be used with
the
.Fl B , b , C , c ,
.Fl p ,
or
.Fl s
options.
.It Fl F
Flush the file's contents to disk.
When copying a file, use the
.Xr fsync 2
function to synchronize the installed file's contents with the
on-disk version.
.It Fl g Ar group
Specify a
.Ar group .
A numeric GID is allowed.
.It Fl m Ar mode
Specify an alternate
.Ar mode .
The default mode is set to rwxr-xr-x (0755).
The specified mode may be either an octal or symbolic value; see
.Xr chmod 1
for a description of possible mode values.
.It Fl M
Disable use of
.Xr mmap 2
when installing the target.
.It Fl o Ar owner
Specify an
.Ar owner .
A numeric UID is allowed.
.It Fl p
Preserve the modification time.
Copy the file, as if the
.Fl C
(compare and copy) option is specified,
except if the target file does not exist or is different, then
preserve the modification time of the source file.
.It Fl S
Safe copy.
This is the default.  Using this option has no effect, and is
supported only for compatibility. When installing a file, a
temporary file is safely created and written first in the
destination directory, then atomically renamed. This avoids
both race conditions and the destruction of existing
files in case of disk or system failures.
.It Fl s
Strip the file. The external command
.Pa /usr/bin/strip
is called to actually strip the file, so
.Nm
can be portable to a large number of systems and binary types.
See below for how
.Nm
can be instructed to use a different program for stripping binaries.
.It Fl U
Indicate that
.Nm
is running unprivileged. Any errors while setting the owner, group,
or mode of the target will be non-fatal to the installation
process.
.It Fl v
Cause
.Nm
to be verbose. Progress information will be printed to standard output
as directories are created and files are installed or backed up.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto itself.
.Pp
Installing
.Pa /dev/null
creates an empty file.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Nm
utility checks for the presence of the
STRIPBIN
and
STRIP
environment variables. If defined, the assigned value will be
used as the
.Xr strip 1
program to run. If both variables are set,
STRIP
is overriding.
The default strip(1) program is
.Pa /usr/bin/strip .
.Pp
If the
DONTSTRIP
environment variable is present,
.Nm
will not strip files, ignoring any specification of the
.Fl s
option.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width INS@XXXXXX -compact
.It Pa INS@XXXXXX
Temporary files created in the target directory by
.Xr mkstemp 3 .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std xinstall
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chgrp 1 ,
.Xr chmod 1 ,
.Xr cmp 1 ,
.Xr cp 1 ,
.Xr ln 1 ,
.Xr mv 1 ,
.Xr strip 1 ,
.Xr mmap 2 ,
.Xr chown 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
is not standardized by POSIX.  Furthermore, there there is no fully
compatible subset of options available across all systems which
implement the
.Nm
utility. Even amongst the BSD-derived systems, the
.Fl C ,
.Fl D ,
.Fl F ,
.Fl p ,
.Fl S ,
.Fl U ,
and
.Fl v
flags are non-standard, and cannot be relied upon for portability.
.Pp
Errors when stripping files are not fatal to the
.Nm
process.
.Pp
Temporary files may be left in the target directory if
.Nm
exits abnormally.
.Pp
.Nm
options should be specified before any sources or the target, to
avoid ambiguities between filenames, directories, and options
when
.Nm
parses the command line.
.Pp
The exact behavior of
.Nm
varies depending on the operating system and filesystem.
.Pp
Error messages, warnings, and verbose feedback could be improved.
